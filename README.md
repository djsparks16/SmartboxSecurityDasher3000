# Smartbox Security Dasher 3000 PoC, real-connectors-only build

A hackathon-ready security/infrastructure dashboard with an Apple-ish dark cockpit UI, live telemetry cards, event correlation, connector setup, and no simulated telemetry.

## Run locally

```powershell
python sentinel.py
```

The app opens in real-connector-only mode. If no connector is enabled, the dashboard shows zeros and a “Waiting for live connector data” event.

## Build a Windows EXE locally

On a Windows build machine:

```powershell
cd smartbox_sentinel_poc
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name SmartboxSecurityDasher3000 sentinel.py
```

Your executable appears here:

```text
dist\SmartboxSecurityDasher3000.exe
```

## Build a Windows EXE with GitHub Actions

Yes, you can do this via Git.

1. Create a new private GitHub repo.
2. Upload or push this folder to the repo.
3. Go to **Actions**.
4. Run the workflow named **Build Windows EXE**, or just push to `main`.
5. Download the artifact named **SmartboxSecurityDasher3000-Windows**.
6. Inside it, open `SmartboxSecurityDasher3000.exe`.

## Connector setup

Open **Setup connectors** in the app and enable only the systems you want.

### Microsoft Graph / Intune / Defender alerts

Create an Entra ID app registration and grant application permissions such as:

- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`
- `SecurityAlert.Read.All`

Enter Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret in the Microsoft tab.

### UniFi

Enter the official UniFi API base URL and API key.

### Datto RMM

Enter your Datto RMM API URL and bearer token.

### RocketCyber

Enter the RocketCyber API hostname and API key or bearer token.

## Security posture

- Read-only connector design.
- No simulated operational telemetry.
- Secrets are stored with Windows DPAPI when running on Windows.
- Each connector degrades independently instead of killing the dashboard.

## Suggested hackathon demo line

“This is a read-only live correlation cockpit. It normalizes Microsoft compliance, security alerts, RMM/EDR state, and network health into a single operational view. No fake telemetry in this build: if a connector is not live, it says so.”


## Microsoft connector patch notes

This build uses safer Microsoft Graph requests:

```text
/deviceManagement/managedDevices?$top=80
/security/alerts_v2?$top=25
```

It also supports partial success. If Intune works but security alerts fail, the dashboard still shows Microsoft Graph as live and displays an alert-query warning in the signal feed.


## UI clarity patch notes

- Severity-coloured KPI cards with status hints
- Overview state banner (healthy / watch / elevated / critical)
- Signal feed sorted by severity with stronger colour separation
- Risk chart line colour tracks current risk
- Footer now summarises live state, alert load, and compliance drift


## Full inventory patch notes

This build follows Microsoft Graph `@odata.nextLink` pagination for Intune managed devices. The earlier build only read the first page, which meant large estates could appear capped at 80 devices.

It also adds an operating system breakdown strip for Windows, iPhone/iPad, Mac, Android, and Other OS counts.


## Defender alerts patch notes

This build adds a dedicated Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alert connector alongside Microsoft Graph Security alerts.

The Microsoft tab still uses the same Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret. Add the Defender API application permission in Entra/Microsoft Defender as needed:

```text
Alert.Read.All
```

Optional future enrichment:

```text
Machine.Read.All
```

The dashboard now shows:

```text
Active alerts = Graph Security alerts + Defender for Endpoint alerts
Defender alerts = dedicated Defender for Endpoint API count
Graph security alerts = Microsoft Graph security alert count
```

The Defender API call used is:

```text
https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/alerts?$top=100
```

The app also requests a Defender token using:

```text
https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/.default
```

If Defender permissions are not granted, the dashboard still works with Intune and Graph Security. The Signal feed will show "Microsoft Defender alert query failed" so you can fix permissions without breaking the whole demo.
